In new research on the global electric vehicle market, it estimated 6.5 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2021, up 109 percent year-on-year. It concluded fully electric and plug-in hybrid passenger cars as electric vehicles.

Electric vehicle sales represented 9 percent of all passenger car sales in 2021, and 85 percent of vehicle sold globally were delivered to customers in the Chinese mainland an Europe.

Let's take a look at the top electric vehicle carmakers by market share in 2021.

- Hyundai Motors Market share: 5 percent
